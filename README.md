<h1>Gambler: Queen's Cup</h1>

<img width="165" height="231" align="right" src="https://github.com/DerekPascarella/GamblerQueensCup-EnglishPatchFMTowns/blob/main/images/cover.jpg?raw=true">English translation patch for the eroge dating/horse betting simulation game "Gambler: Queen's Cup" on the FM Towns/FM Towns Marty.
<br><br>
Players see the world through the eyes of Mr. Takagi, an avid sports better fixated on horse races. One day, a realization dawns on him. The epiphany? He needs to settle down and find true love.
<br><br>
Until that moment, Mr. Takagi had only seen women as useful for one-night stands, and little else. In fact, anything that got in the way of his love for the ponies (including women) had been nothing more than a nuisance, and something standing in the way of his next big bet.
<br><br>
It's now time for him to make his biggest (and riskiest) gamble yet: choosing the woman of his dreams!
