<img width="165" height="231" align="right" src="https://github.com/DerekPascarella/GamblerQueensCup-EnglishPatchFMTowns/blob/main/images/cover.jpg?raw=true">English translation patch for the eroge dating/horse betting simulation game "Gambler: Queen's Cup" on the FM Towns/FM Towns Marty.
<br><br>
Players see the world through the eyes of Mr. Takagi, an avid sports better fixated on horse races. One day, a realization dawns on him. The epiphany? He needs to settle down and find true love.
<br><br>
Until that moment, Mr. Takagi had only seen women as useful for one-night stands, and little else. In fact, anything that got in the way of his love for the ponies (including women) had been nothing more than a nuisance, and something standing in the way of his next big bet.
<br><br>
It's now time for him to make his biggest (and riskiest) gamble yet: choosing the woman of his dreams!

    <br>
    The English-patched version of this game can be burned to CD-R and played on FM Towns Marty or any FM Towns computer.
    <br><br>
    Saving game progress requires either a working floppy disk drive or an FDD emulator (such as the <a href="https://www.gotekemulator.com/">GoTek</a> or <a href="https://caiusarcade.blogspot.com/2021/05/the-thing-fm-towns-marty-fdd-emulator.html">The Thing</a>). Like many FM Towns titles, this game needs a specially formatted save disk. If you are using a floppy drive emulator, you can download and use the pre-made save disk image provided below. Alternatively, a save disk can be created from the title screen menu by inserting a blank disk, either physically or through the emulator.

<h2>Cheat Tool</h2>

<img align="right" width="300" src="https://github.com/DerekPascarella/GamblerQueensCup-EnglishPatchFMTowns/blob/main/images/gameplay_25.png?raw=true">Players who wish to cheat and modify the amount of money held by their player can do so by using a special tool developed exclusively for the release of this English translation Patch. This is particularly useful for those who find themselves unamused with the horse betting mechanic required to fund Mr. Takagi's romantic affairs.
<br><br>
Usage is simple: download <a href="https://github.com/DerekPascarella/GamblerQueensCup-EnglishPatchFMTowns/raw/refs/heads/main/custom_tools/save_mod.exe">save_mod.exe</a> and then drag any floppy save disk image in <tt>.d88</tt> format onto the executable itself. A menu will appear providing options for money modification.
<br><br>
Conversion between <tt>.d88</tt>, <tt>.hfe</tt>, and other formats can be achieved with tools like <a href="https://hxc2001.com/download/floppy_drive_emulator/">HxC Floppy Emulator Software</a>.
